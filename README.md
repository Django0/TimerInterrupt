# Arduino TimerInterrupt Library

This library enables you to use Interrupt from Hardware Timers on an Arduino, such as Nano, UNO, Mega, etc.

Why do we need this Hardware Timer Interrupt?

Imagine you have a system with a mission-critical function, measuring water level and control the sump pump or doing something much more important.
You normally use a software timer to poll, or even place the function in loop(). But what if another function is blocking the loop() or setup().

So your function might not be executed, and the result would be disastrous.

You'd prefer to have your function called, no matter what happening with other functions (busy loop, bug, etc.).

The correct choice is to use a Hardware Timer with Interrupt to call your function.

These hardware timers, using interrupt, still works even if other functions is blocking. Moreover, they are much more precise (certainly depending on clock frequency accurary) than other software timers using millis() or micros(). That's necessary if you need to measure some data with better accuracy.

Functions using normal software timers, relying on loop() and calling millis(), won't work if the loop() or setup() is blocked by certain operation. For example, certain function is blocking while it's connecting to WiFi or some services.

The catch is your function is now part of an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine), and must be lean / mean, and follow certain rules. More to read on:

**Important Notes:**
1. Inside the attached function, delay() wonâ€™t work and the value returned by millis() will not increment. Serial data received while in the function may be lost. You should declare as volatile any variables that you modify within the attached function.

2. Typically global variables are used to pass data between an ISR and the main program. To make sure variables shared between an ISR and the main program are updated correctly, declare them as volatile.

## Installation
1. Navigate to (https://github.com/khoih-prog/TimerInterrupt/releases) page.
2. Download the latest release `TimerInterrupt-master.zip`.
3. Extract the zip file to `TimerInterrupt-master` directory 
4. Copy whole folder to Arduino libraries' directory such as `.Arduino/libraries/TimerInterrupt-master`.

## More useful Information

From https://www.robotshop.com/community/forum/t/arduino-101-timers-and-interrupts/13072

1. Timer0:
Timer0 is a 8bit timer.
In the Arduino world timer0 is been used for the timer functions, like delay(), millis() and micros(). If you change Timer0 registers, this may influence the Arduino timer function. So you should know what you are doing.

2. Timer1:
Timer1 is a 16bit timer.
In the Arduino world the Servo library uses timer1 on Arduino Uno (Timer5 on Arduino Mega).

3. Timer2:
Timer2 is a 8bit timer like Timer0.
In the Arduino work the tone() function uses Timer2.

4. Timer3, Timer4, Timer5:
Timer 3,4,5 are only available on Arduino Mega boards. These timers are all 16bit timers.

## Supported Arduino Boards
- Arduino Uno / Mega / Leonardo / Duemilanove / Diecimila / LilyPad / Mini / Fio / Nano etc.
- Teensy 1.0 / 1.0++ / 2.0 / 2++ / 3.0 / 3.1 / Teensy-LC;
- Sanguino
- ATmega8, 48, 88, 168, 328
- ATmega8535, 16, 32, 164, 324, 644, 1284,
- ATmega64, 128
- ATtiny 84 / 85

## Usage

Before using any Timer, you have to make sure the Timer has not been used by any other purpose.

Only Timer1 and Timer2 are supported for Nano, UNO, etc. boards possessing 3 timers.
Timer3, Timer4 and Timer5 are supported for Arduino Maga boards.

How to use:

```
//These define's must be placed at the beginning before #include "TimerInterrupt.h"
#define TIMER_INTERRUPT_DEBUG      0

#define USE_TIMER_1     true
#define USE_TIMER_2     true
#define USE_TIMER_3     false
#define USE_TIMER_4     false
#define USE_TIMER_5     false

#include "TimerInterrupt.h"

void TimerHandler1(void)
{
  static bool toggle1 = false;
  static bool started = false;

  if (!started)
  {
    started = true;
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  }

  //timer interrupt toggles pin LED_BUILTIN
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, toggle1);
  toggle1 = !toggle1;
}

void TimerHandler2(void)
{
  static bool toggle2 = false;
  static bool started = false;

  if (!started)
  {
    started = true;
    pinMode(A0, OUTPUT);
  }
  
  //timer interrupt toggles outputPin
  digitalWrite(A0, toggle2);
  toggle2 = !toggle2;
}

#define TIMER1_INTERVAL_MS    1000

#define TIMER2_INTERVAL_MS    2000

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("\nStarting");

  // Select Timer 1-2 for UNO, 0-5 for MEGA
  // Timer 2 is 8-bit timer, only for higher frequency   
  ITimer1.init();
   
  // Using ATmega328 used in UNO => 16MHz CPU clock , 
  
  if (ITimer1.attachInterruptInterval(TIMER1_INTERVAL_MS, TimerHandler1))
    Serial.println("Starting  ITimer1 OK, millis() = " + String(millis()));
  else
    Serial.println("Can't set ITimer1. Select another freq. or timer");

  // Select Timer 1-2 for UNO, 0-5 for MEGA
  // Timer 2 is 8-bit timer, only for higher frequency       
  ITimer2.init();
      
  if (ITimer2.attachInterruptInterval(TIMER2_INTERVAL_MS, TimerHandler2))
    Serial.println("Starting  ITimer2 OK, millis() = " + String(millis()));
  else
    Serial.println("Can't set ITimer2. Select another freq. or timer");    
}

void loop()
{
  
}

```
## TO DO

1. Similar library for ESP8266 and ESP32


## DONE

For current version v1.0.1

1. Longer Interval for timers.
2. Reduce code size if use less timers. Eliminate compiler warnings.
3. Now supporting complex object pointer-type argument.
4. Fix some bugs in v1.0.0
5. Add more examples.
